    "Byte-Pair Encoding tokenization\n",
    "Ask a Question\n",
    "Open In Colab\n",
    "Open In Studio Lab\n",
    "Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) was initially developed as an algorithm to compress texts, and then used by OpenAI for tokenization when pretraining the GPT model. It’s used by a lot of Transformer models, including GPT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, BART, and DeBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 This section covers BPE in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation. You can skip to the end if you just want a general overview of the tokenization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training algorithm\n",
    "BPE training starts by computing the unique set of words used in the corpus (after the normalization and pre-tokenization steps are completed), then building the vocabulary by taking all the symbols used to write those words. As a very simple example, let’s say our corpus uses these five words:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied\n",
    "\"hug\", \"pug\", \"pun\", \"bun\", \"hugs\"\n",
    "The base vocabulary will then be [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\"]. For real-world cases, that base vocabulary will contain all the ASCII characters, at the very least, and probably some Unicode characters as well. If an example you are tokenizing uses a character that is not in the training corpus, that character will be converted to the unknown token. That’s one reason why lots of NLP models are very bad at analyzing content with emojis, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-2 and RoBERTa tokenizers (which are pretty similar) have a clever way to deal with this: they don’t look at words as being written with Unicode characters, but with bytes. This way the base vocabulary has a small size (256), but every character you can think of will still be included and not end up being converted to the unknown token. This trick is called byte-level BPE.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting this base vocabulary, we add new tokens until the desired vocabulary size is reached by learning merges, which are rules to merge two elements of the existing vocabulary together into a new one. So, at the beginning these merges will create tokens with two characters, and then, as training progresses, longer subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any step during the tokenizer training, the BPE algorithm will search for the most frequent pair of existing tokens (by “pair,” here we mean two consecutive tokens in a word). That most frequent pair is the one that will be merged, and we rinse and repeat for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our previous example, let’s assume the words had the following frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied\n",
    "(\"hug\", 10), (\"pug\", 5), (\"pun\", 12), (\"bun\", 4), (\"hugs\", 5)\n",
    "meaning \"hug\" was present 10 times in the corpus, \"pug\" 5 times, \"pun\" 12 times, \"bun\" 4 times, and \"hugs\" 5 times. We start the training by splitting each word into characters (the ones that form our initial vocabulary) so we can see each word as a list of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied\n",
    "(\"h\" \"u\" \"g\", 10), (\"p\" \"u\" \"g\", 5), (\"p\" \"u\" \"n\", 12), (\"b\" \"u\" \"n\", 4), (\"h\" \"u\" \"g\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "Then we look at pairs. The pair (\"h\", \"u\") is present in the words \"hug\" and \"hugs\", so 15 times total in the corpus. It’s not the most frequent pair, though: that honor belongs to (\"u\", \"g\"), which is present in \"hug\", \"pug\", and \"hugs\", for a grand total of 20 times in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the first merge rule learned by the tokenizer is (\"u\", \"g\") -> \"ug\", which means that \"ug\" will be added to the vocabulary, and the pair should be merged in all the words of the corpus. At the end of this stage, the vocabulary and corpus look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied\n",
    "Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\"]\n",
    "Corpus: (\"h\" \"ug\", 10), (\"p\" \"ug\", 5), (\"p\" \"u\" \"n\", 12), (\"b\" \"u\" \"n\", 4), (\"h\" \"ug\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "Now we have some pairs that result in a token longer than two characters: the pair (\"h\", \"ug\"), for instance (present 15 times in the corpus). The most frequent pair at this stage is (\"u\", \"n\"), however, present 16 times in the corpus, so the second merge rule learned is (\"u\", \"n\") -> \"un\". Adding that to the vocabulary and merging all existing occurrences leads us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied\n",
    "Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\", \"un\"]\n",
    "Corpus: (\"h\" \"ug\", 10), (\"p\" \"ug\", 5), (\"p\" \"un\", 12), (\"b\" \"un\", 4), (\"h\" \"ug\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "Now the most frequent pair is (\"h\", \"ug\"), so we learn the merge rule (\"h\", \"ug\") -> \"hug\", which gives us our first three-letter token. After the merge, the corpus looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied\n",
    "Vocabulary: [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\", \"ug\", \"un\", \"hug\"]\n",
    "Corpus: (\"hug\", 10), (\"p\" \"ug\", 5), (\"p\" \"un\", 12), (\"b\" \"un\", 4), (\"hug\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "And we continue like this until we reach the desired vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "✏️ Now your turn! What do you think the next merge rule will be?\n",

    "Tokenization algorithm\n",

    "Splitting the words into individual characters\n",

    "Copied\n",
    "(\"u\", \"g\") -> \"ug\"\n",
    "(\"u\", \"n\") -> \"un\"\n",
    "(\"h\", \"ug\") -> \"hug\"\n",
    "The word \"bug\" will be tokenized as [\"b\", \"ug\"]. \"mug\", however, will be tokenized as [\"[UNK]\", \"ug\"] since the letter \"m\" was not in the base vocabulary. Likewise, the word \"thug\" will be tokenized as [\"[UNK]\", \"hug\"]: the letter \"t\" is not in the base vocabulary, and applying the merge rules results first in \"u\" and \"g\" being merged and then \"h\" and \"ug\" being merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "✏️ Now your turn! How do you think the word \"unhug\" will be tokenized?\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing BPE\n",
    "Now let’s take a look at an implementation of the BPE algorithm. This won’t be an optimized version you can actually use on a big corpus; we just want to show you the code so you can understand the algorithm a little bit better.\n",
